## Summary

- From the results above paid % of 5 star reviews is 44.38% and unpaid % of 5 star reviews is 44.00 %. Thus, there is no bias. This describes a positivity bias for reviews in the Vine program.
- Additionally we could analyse the statistical distribution of the star rating for the Vine and non-Vine reviews.
